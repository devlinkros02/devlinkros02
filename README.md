👋 Hey there! I'm Devlin, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast diving into the world of software development at @codam-coding-college (42 Network). 💻

🔍 Currently learning the basics of C, but always up for exploring new languages. 🚀

🛠️ I'm all about tinkering with projects and solving puzzles, one line of code at a time. 💡

💼 Looking to connect with fellow beginners and seasoned pros to learn, grow, and maybe even collaborate on some cool stuff!
