Hey!

I'm Devlin, a software engineering student at [Codam Coding College](https://codam.com/about-codam).

At Codam, we follow [42's Core Curriculum](https://42.fr/en/the-program/innovative-learning/), focussed mainly on C and C++,
but you finish the study with a project that allows you to use languages of your own liking.

I am currently employed as a junior, and am getting more familiar with the following languages, tools and frameworks every day:

JavaScript,
Vue,
Nuxt,
Python,
Django,
HTML,
CSS (mostly tailwind),
Docker.
